  <h2 class="crema">A community of care and curiosity</h2>
  <p>We believe food created with care and enjoyed with good company is just as essential to health as any specific nutrient. Bread has been at the core of communities for millenia and its ability to support wellbeing is rooted in the way it brings people together. Curiosity and conviviality around the table is a key to growth, learning, and health.</p>
