title: How should I store the bread?
---

### 1-3 days

Store the bread in a paper or cotton bag, or in a breathable plastic bag at room temperature. If the bread is cut, store it cut side down in the bag to keep the interior from drying out. Do not store the bread in the refrigerator! The refrigerator is a dry environment that will make the bread dry out quickly.

### 4-7 days

Store the bread in a sealable plastic bag at room temperature. If the bread is cut, store it cut side down in the bag. The crust will lose some crispness, but will stay moist longer and not dry out in the sealed environment. The bread can be crisped up again in the oven or toasted to regain crispiness! Do not store the bread in the refrigerator! The refrigerator is a dry environment that will make the bread dry out quickly.

### Long term storage

Sourdough bread freezes very well. To freeze, slice the bread or leave loaf whole, then wrap tightly with aluminum foil or plastic freezer wrap, or place in heavy-duty freezer bag and freeze. Properly stored, it will maintain best quality for about 3 months, but will remain safe beyond that time.
